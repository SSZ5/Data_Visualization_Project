**To run this code, follow these steps:**

1. Click on the "Open in Colab" button.
2. Click on "Runtime" in the menu bar, then select "Run all".
3. The first code block will download the data and save it to your local runtime environment.
4. Once the first code block has completed running, proceed to run the following code block to import all necessary libraries.
5. After running all the code blocks, the output will be displayed in the output window.

Note: This code can also be run on Jupyter by copying and pasting the code into a Jupyter notebook.


**Data**
The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/equilibriumm/sleep-efficiency . Alternatively, the data will be available once the first code block is run in the notebook.
